I enjoy solving problems no matter what their nature. I am a natural teacher, an excellent communicator, and a proven leadership track record. Experienced in working across multiple disciplines and roles. I&#8217;m a knowledge junkie who never tires of learning something new.<\/div>\n<div>That&#8217;s enough of the elevator pitch. This site is the \u201cun-design\u201d of my portfolio to offer links to my work\/code\/designs and provide a bit of background and insight into my experience. Rather than drabble on about myself or my work I\u2019ll just hit on a few points in the Q&amp;A below.\u00a0<\/div>\n<h2>So what&#8217;s up with the site \u2018design\u2019?<\/h2>\n<div>The design (or lack thereof) is really just so that I could have a simple way to display some of my work without getting so hung up on the \u2018wrapping paper\u2019. And let&#8217;s be honest, designers are their own worst client and I\u2019m no exception. I HATE doing work for myself because I can get hung up on trying to make it \u201ctoo cool\u201d or using all of the latest technology when really all that\u2019s required is an easy way to view the work. That&#8217;s why most designer portfolios get a redesign once a decade\u2026 because we suck as clients. Therefore I chose to remove the \u2018must be the coolest design ever imagined\u2019 requirement from the project scope.<\/div>\n<h2>Is this really all the work you could come up with after 20+ years?<\/h2>\n<div>Uhh&#8230; no. I don&#8217;t freelance much (at all) anymore but when I did, a lot of the work was under NDA\/non-advertise\/non-compete agreements so some of those projects aren&#8217;t displayed. Other freelance work either isn&#8217;t a current representation of my abilities, no longer online or its just old. I do have a 9-5 (or more accurately a 7-6) job and do a lot of design and development every day. Not everything I do daily is \u2018portfolio material\u2019.\u00a0<\/div>\n<h2>Aren\u2019t you just a \u2018Flash\u2019 guy, what&#8217;s with the HTML site?<\/h2>\n<div>Granted, a lot of the freelance work I have done in the past has been Flash-based, but let me be clear. Much like a mechanic isn&#8217;t defined by the wrench in his toolbox, I am not defined by the tools I use. I think Flash\u00a0was\u00a0a great platform that allowed me to express an idea without compromise and deliver a more immersive experience than HTML could ever hope to do. That being said I was coding HTML\/CSS\/JS by hand long before \u2013 and during the time \u2013 I started working with Flash. Flash was just a tool like jQuery\/Vuejs\/React\/TypeScript\/Photoshop\/Etc.. are all just tools. I won&#8217;t go into my disappointment with where the Flash platform has gone here. I will say that technologies will come and go and if you are stuck being defined by any one of them you are doing yourself a great disservice.\u00a0<\/div>\n<h2>Did you write every single line of code for this site?<\/h2>\n<div>No, absolutely not. I\u2019m a fan of not reinventing the wheel and not too proud to say if a solid code library\/framework has already been created to do something I want to do, I use it. Why anyone gets hung up on the need to write everything from scratch is beyond me. That being said, this awesome template of supreme eye candy you see before you (sarcasm) is created with React\/Vuejs (separate implementations) for the front end (with a little Bulma css sprinkled in as a base) and the WordPress REST API to provide the data. It&#8217;s not a template, theme or website builder. Why so bland you ask? Well, removing the &#8220;has to be the coolest design ever&#8221; requirement provides me a way to get rid of my absolute worst client&#8230; myself. As I&#8217;ve already mentioned, I hate doing work for myself, I&#8217;m my own worst critic. I&#8217;m also the worst person to communicate requirements to myself, its a perpetual argument with no winner.<\/div>\n<h2>Wait a minute, are you a designer or a developer?<\/h2>\n<div>Do I have to be either or? I realize that nowadays people are choosing to become\/becoming more \u2018specialized\u2019 as an information architect, a Photoshop artist, an HTML\/CSS coder, or a Javascript developer, etc.. When I started in this industry you were either a front-end or back-end guy. I have always worked hard to make sure I stayed capable of being able to deliver the entire UI. Whether it\u2019s brainstorming, to a concept, to mock-up, to art direction, and finally to production ready code that has to be maintained. I\u2019m very comfortable with every aspect of the UI. If it&#8217;s on this side of the server, that&#8217;s my gig. I think its important for the designer to be able to understand information delivery and usability when they are creating a mock-up. It\u2019s equally important to understand if\/how something can be coded while they are\u00a0in Photoshop\/Sketch. And when the picture has to become reality it\u2019s inevitable that pixels will change when converted to a coded page\/widget\/application and therefore the UI developer\/coder needs to understand what pixels can be altered without losing the integrity of the design.<\/div>\n<div>It\u2019s also a nice balance for me. I can float back and forth between Photoshop\/Sketch and code which allows me to not get too burnt out on either. That&#8217;s just the way I was taught and that&#8217;s how I continue to progress in my career.<\/div>\n<h2>So this all tells me nothing, who are you?<\/h2>\n<div>I\u2019m just a guy with a lot of tattoos that likes crayons a little too much. A father of two awesome kids, husband to a wife that lets me think I\u2019m cool, a devoted Boston Celtic fan, former basketball coach, horrible guitar player, wannabe mechanic, and an all-around nice guy (subject to change\/debate\/opinion).
